# LazyBeads

A terminal user interface for managing [beads](https://github.com/anthropics/beads) issues, inspired by [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

Navigate, create, and manage your project issues without leaving the terminal.

## Features

- **Three-panel layout** - See In Progress, Open, and Closed issues at a glance
- **Vim-style navigation** - `j/k` to move, `h/l` to switch panels
- **Quick editing** - Edit title, status, priority, or type with single keystrokes
- **Filter & search** - Use `/` to filter issues by title or ID
- **Detail view** - Press `Enter` to see full issue details
- **External editor** - Edit descriptions with `$EDITOR` (defaults to nano)
- **Custom commands** - Define your own keybindings for workflows

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- `bd` CLI installed and available in PATH

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/youruser/lazybeads@latest
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/lazybeads
cd lazybeads
go install .
```

## Usage

Run `lazybeads` in any directory with beads initialized:

```bash
cd your-project
lazybeads
```

If beads isn't initialized, you'll be prompted to set it up.

### Validation mode

Verify the bd CLI integration works:

```bash
lazybeads --check
```

### Config diagnostics

Check configuration file loading status and debug custom command issues:

```bash
lazybeads --config
```

This shows:
- Which config file path is being used
- Whether the file exists and parses correctly
- List of loaded custom commands

    description: "Start work in new tmux pane"
    context: "list"  # list, detail, or global
    command: "tmux split-window -h 'claude --issue {{.ID}}'"

  - key: "b"
    description: "Open in browser"
    context: "list"
    command: "open 'https://your-tracker.com/issues/{{.ID}}'"
```

Available template variables:

- `{{.ID}}` - Issue ID
- `{{.Title}}` - Issue title
- `{{.Status}}` - Status (open, in_progress, closed)
- `{{.Type}}` - Type (task, bug, feature, epic, chore)
